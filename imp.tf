## What is Docker and why is it used?
## Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver             software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications.
## What is the purpose of Docker?
## Docker is an open source containerization platform. It enables developers to package applications into containers—standardized executable components combining application    source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment.

For millions of developers today, Docker is the de facto standard to build and share containerized apps - from  desktop, to the cloud. We are building on our unique connected experience from code to cloud for developers and developer teams.
