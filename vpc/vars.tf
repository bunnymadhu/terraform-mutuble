## What does CIDR mean--CIDR stands for Classlesss Inter-Domain Routing. It enables network administrators to group blocks of IP addresses into single routing networks. CIDR                                               accomplishes the same task as traditional subnet masking. To understand what CIDR notation means, take the IP address 192.168.
